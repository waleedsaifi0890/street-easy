StreetEasy is New York City’s leading local real estate marketplace, with mobile and web-based versions, providing comprehensive property listings and market data.

## Features

- Search
- Contact with an agent
- Communication
- Scrapping
- Integration with NYC.gov sources
- 3D Tours



## Search

Users can search for properties by price, keywords, addresses, number of rooms, and other advanced options.





## Agent Engagement

StreetEasy users can see agents responsible for property listings, and those that cover specific areas of NYC, and choose the one they want to deal with through the app.
 


## Communication

Communication between users and agents is performed through messages within the app, and phone calls, which are tracked using Twilio, a cloud communications platform.




## Scrapping

Adding listings from third-party sites is achieved with the help of scraping, a technology for obtaining web data by extracting it from external websites.



## 3D Tours

StreetEasy supports 3D tours that help potential buyers and renters view properties they’re interested in without viewing in-person. This is proving really useful and essential in the era of Covid-19.
